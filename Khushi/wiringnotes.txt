RST and SLP pins need to go to 3.3V on RPi

DIR pins can go to any GPIO out pins on the RPI

Power supply 8.2 to 45 Volts

VMOT to power supply positive terminal

Keep motor power leads short
Minimum 47 UF electrolytic capacitor across motor supply - negative is vertical stripe
Cap w double the voltage rating

Motor power supply positive wire shouldn't touch anything except the DRV

Use VREF to determine supply limit
run at ab .4
